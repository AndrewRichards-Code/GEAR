GEAR (Game Engine Andrew Richards) is a 3D game engine, that I am developing to improve both my C++ and graphic programming, using my own Graphics (MIRU) and Mathematics (MARS) libraries. 
Inspired by Yan Chernikov's (aka TheCheno) videos on C++, OpenGL and Game Engines. https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject
